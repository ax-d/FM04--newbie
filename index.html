      <h1>Compost</h1>
      <p><b>Compost</b> (<a href="#">/ˈkɒmpɒst/</a> or <a href="#">/ˈkɒmpoʊst/</a>) is organic matter that has been <a
          href="#">decomposed</a> in a process called composting. This process <a href="#">recycles</a> various <a
          href="#">organic materials</a> otherwise regarded as waste products and produces a <a href="#">soil
          conditioner</a> (the compost).</p>
      <p>Compost is rich in nutrients. It is used, for example, in <a href="#">gardens</a>, <a href="#">landscaping</a>,
        <a href="#">horticulture</a>, <a href="#">urban agriculture</a> and <a href="#">organic farming</a>. The compost
        itself is beneficial for the land in many ways, including as a soil conditioner, a <a href="#">fertilizer</a>,
        addition of vital <a href="#">humus</a> or <a href="#">humic acids</a>, and as a natural pesticide for soil.
        Compost is useful for erosion control, land and stream reclamation, wetland construction, and as landfill cover.
      </p>
      <p>At the simplest level, the process of composting requires making a heap of wet organic matter (also called
        green waste), such as leaves, grass, and food scraps, and waiting for the materials to break down into humus
        after a period of months. However, composting can also take place as a multi-step, closely monitored process
        with measured inputs of water, air, and carbon- and nitrogen-rich materials. The decomposition process is aided
        by shredding the plant matter, adding water and ensuring proper aeration by regularly turning the mixture when
        open piles or "windrows" are used. Fungi, earthworms and other detritivores further break up the material.
        Aerobic bacteria and fungi manage the chemical process by converting the inputs into heat, carbon dioxide, and
        ammonium.</p>
      <h2>Fundamentals</h2>
      <p>Composting is an aerobic method (meaning that it requires the presence of air) of decomposing organic solid
        wastes.[1] It can therefore be used to recycle organic material. The process involves decomposition of organic
        material into a humus-like material, known as compost, which is a good fertilizer for plants. Composting
        requires the following three components: human management, aerobic conditions, and development of internal
        biological heat.
        <br />
        Composting organisms require four equally important ingredients to work effectively:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Carbon</b> — for energy; the microbial oxidation of carbon produces the heat, if included at suggested
          levels.[2] High carbon materials tend to be brown and dry.</li>
        <li><b>Nitrogen</b> — to grow and reproduce more organisms to oxidize the carbon. High nitrogen materials tend
          to be green (or colorful, such as fruits and vegetables) and wet.</li>
        <li><b>Oxygen</b> — for oxidizing the carbon, the decomposition process.</li>
        <li><b>Water</b> — in the right amounts to maintain activity without causing anaerobic conditions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Certain ratios of these materials will provide microorganisms to work at a rate that will heat up the pile.
        Active management of the pile (e.g. turning) is needed to maintain sufficient supply of oxygen and the right
        moisture level. The air/water balance is critical to maintaining high temperatures 130–160 °F (54–71 °C) until
        the materials are broken down.</p>
      <h3>Heading size h3</h3>
      <p>The most efficient composting occurs with an optimal carbon:nitrogen ratio of about 25:1.[5] Hot container
        composting focuses on retaining the heat to increase decomposition rate and produce compost more quickly. Rapid
        composting is favored by having a C/N ratio of ~30 or less. Above 30 the substrate is nitrogen starved, below 15
        it is likely to outgas a portion of nitrogen as ammonia.[6]</p>
      <h4>Heading size h4</h4>
      <p>Nearly all plant and animal materials have both carbon and nitrogen, but amounts vary widely, with
        characteristics noted above (dry/wet, brown/green).[7] Fresh grass clippings have an average ratio of about 15:1
        and dry autumn leaves about 50:1 depending on species. Mixing equal parts by volume approximates the ideal C:N
        range. Few individual situations will provide the ideal mix of materials at any point. Observation of amounts,
        and consideration of different materials as a pile is built over time, can quickly achieve a workable technique
        for the individual situation.</p>
